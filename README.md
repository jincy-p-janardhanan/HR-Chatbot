# HR-Chatbot
An AI based HR chatbot which replies to user queries by learning from the organization's user manual for employees (text file input).

The chatbot agent learns entities from the manual for employees and applies this knowledge to answer user queries. 

It is built on [**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com) with [**DialogFlow**](https://dialogflow.com).

I am doing this project as part of the [**"Building Conversational Experiences with Dialogflow"**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conversational-experiences-dialogflow) course on [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org).
